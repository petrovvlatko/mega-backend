## TODO: 
* Re-think about how to store and handle user subscription tiers and access
  * Do we keep the role solely in the users table and remove it from the subapps table?
  * Do we care about giving each individual subapp their own sub tier, or one tier for all?

* Perhaps the frontend has one home sign-in and sign-up page for all subapps?
